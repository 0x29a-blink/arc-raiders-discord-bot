## Code Style & Linting

- Use TypeScript and follow the existing code style.

- Before submitting code, run:
  - `npm run lint` to check formatting and linting
  - `npm run lint:fix` to auto-fix and format your code
- You can also use Biome directly:
  - Lint: `npx biome lint .`
  - Format: `npx biome format .`
- Please resolve all lint errors before opening a pull request.

## Issues

- Use GitHub Issues to report bugs or request features.
- Please provide as much detail as possible.

## Pull Request Process
